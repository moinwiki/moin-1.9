    MoinMoin - WSGI session handling

    To provide sessions, the MoinMoin WSGI application interacts with an
    object implementing the `SessionService` API. The interface is quite
    straight forward. For documentation of the expected methods, refer
    to the documentation of `SessionService` in this module.

    For example the cookie name for the default desktop wiki: MOIN_SESSION_8080_ROOT

    created by a single farmconfig. If you only run ONE(!) wikiconfig wiki, it
    is also unique, of course, but not if you run multiple wikiconfig wikis under
    same domain.

    want to use that to share stuff between several wikis - just give same name
    and it will use the same cookie. same thing if you don't want to share, just
    give a different name then [e.g. if cfg.siteid or 'siteidmagic' doesn't work
