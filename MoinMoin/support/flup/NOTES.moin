NOTES for bundled flup:
=======================
This directory contains the flup WSGI adapter package. 

The shipped version is available via mercurial checkout:

hg clone -r 3b07cc2b0c76 http://hg.saddi.com/flup-server
# this is flup 1.0.2+, minimum requirement for moin is 1.0.2.

Thanks to Allan Saddi <allan@saddi.com> for writing flup and to
the unnamed contributor <tv@inoi.fi> for the single-thread patch.
