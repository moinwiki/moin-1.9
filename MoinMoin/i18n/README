Translators and Developers,

The data flow for i18n stuff has completely changed, so please read this.

Translators need to deal with the *.po files ONLY - they should do this on
http://moinmaster.wikiwikiweb.de/MoinI18n/<language-code>, please do not
send po updates via email, the stuff from the moinmaster wiki gets processed
automatically.

In moin 1.3 we switched the i18n system to use wiki markup instead html - you
should change the header of your *.po file after adapting to wiki markup,
see de.po for a sample.

Encoding: please use utf-8 ONLY for the po file you submit.

If you don't like to edit using utf-8, see the section below about non-utf-8
editing.

For using the i18n build system, one needs to have "gettext" (e.g. from Debian
unstable) installed. For simply translating text, you do not need it, you can
use a text editor.

Please search your translation for fuzzy and untranslated strings. If you
have reviewed the fuzzy stuff, remove the "fuzzy" marker.

In the source code, there is original english text marked with
_("english string") - xgettext can extract these strings automatically from
the files listed in POTFILES.in.

As not all strings appear in the source code, there is an additional
file i18n/dummy.py that contains strings that need to be translated, but
do not appear in src otherwise or are not found by gettext.



Files
=====

Makefile: a GNU-Makefile

POTFILES.in: a list of files with translatable strings

MoinMoin.pot: Master translation file.

*.po: Translations (utf-8 encoding)

mo/*.mo: Binary output files of msgfmt (this is the stuff moin reads at runtime).


New Translation (no .po file exists yet)
========================================
- copy MoinMoin.pot to <langcode>.po
- edit the header of <langcode>.po (this is the first entry in the file, it
  starts with Project-Id-Version)
  - Project-Id-Version: MoinMoin 1.6
  - Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
  - Language-Team: LANGUAGE mailinglist
    LANGUAGE should be your language in english, in long form - e.g.:
    German, French, ...
  - X-Language: LANGUAGE
    LANGUAGE should be your language expressed in your language, e.g.:
    Deutsch, Francais (with c-cedille), ...

Update Translation
==================
- run "make <langcode>.po"
- change the translation
- update the PO-Revision-Date and Last-Translator entries
- run "make <langcode>.mo"

Change of translatable strings
==============================
If you change any translatable string, please call "make update-po" before
commit.

Regenerating all
================
- run "make" to re-generate everything needed.


Non-utf-8 editing
=================

If you don't like to use a utf-8 capable editor, you could process the po like
that:

Recode the po file to your preferred encoding (e.g. iso-8859-1). Be very sure
that this is possible or you will get errors:

> ./recode.py utf-8 iso-8859-1 <de.po >de.po-iso1

Edit that file and do your work:

> $EDITOR de.po-iso1

Recode your work back to utf-8 for submission. This should generally work if
you specify the "from" encoding (here: iso-8859-1) correctly:

> ./recode.py iso-8859-1 utf-8 <de.po-iso1 >de.po-utf8

Now maybe use this to make sure nothing weird happened:

> diff de.po de.po-utf8

Finally, if everything looked OK:

> mv de.po-utf8 de.po

Also make sure that the Content-Type header in the po file tells charset=utf-8.
