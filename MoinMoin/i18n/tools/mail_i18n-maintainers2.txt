Dear MoinMoin i18n maintainer / translator,

If you are still unfinished with translation - keep in mind that the deadline
for work on MoinMaster stuff (system texts, system and help pages) is at:

               2009-xx-xx 16:00 UTC.


We plan to release MoinMoin 1.9.0 soon. If your translation arrives before last
release steps have begun, it might still get in.

If not, we will include it in development of next version, so it will
be there when we release next version.

Please also don't forget to update status here:

Thanks,

The MoinMoin development team
