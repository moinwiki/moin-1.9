Dear MoinMoin i18n maintainer / translator,

You get this mail because one of the MoinMoin wiki engine's i18n files
lists you as maintainer of it.

By maintaining "%(lang)s", you do great work and all MoinMoin users say
"Thank you" for that (or at least think it ;)!

We are planning to do a new major release (1.9.0) soon, with quite some
attractive new features and lots of cleanup.

See http://moinmo.in/MoinMoinTodo/Release%%201.9 for our planned release schedule.

As it is unlikely that all translators will catch up, we'll just take what we
have at release time. If you fix your stuff early, it'll likely make it into
initial release - if not, you'll have some more chances for every maintenance
release we'll do.


What we need
============

We need your help again for updating the following (high priority and
most important stuff is on top of the list):

[X] IMPORTANT NOTES (please read!): http://moinmo.in/MoinDev/Translation
    (please subscribe to that page, so you get notified on changes)

    We have a nice new tool for checking a translation of the system/help
    pages, try it there:

    http://master19.moinmo.in/MoinI18n/%(lang)s?action=CheckTranslation

    It also helps you to translate important pages first.

[X] http://master19.moinmo.in/MoinI18n/%(lang)s page (source for the .po file)


Please, after translating the current stuff, keep an eye on the master wiki
(or if you prefer email, maybe subscribe to MoinI18n/de - this page is usually
touched by moin development if something changed).

In case you can't do language maintenance any more:
Please remove yourself from the MoinI18n/%(lang)s page by putting ***vacant***
into the Last-Translator: metadata field.

If you have questions, please contact us on the wiki or IRC channel #moin on
server chat.freenode.net.

Thanks,

The MoinMoin development team
