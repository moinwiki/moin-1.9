Dear MoinMoin i18n maintainer / translator,

You get this mail because one of the MoinMoin wiki engine's i18n files
lists you as maintainer of it.

By maintaining "%(lang)s", you do great work and all MoinMoin users say
"Thank you" for that (or at least think it ;)!

We are planning to do a new major release soon, with quite some attractive
new features and lots of cleanup.

What we need
============

Please note that we currently have 2 "MoinMaster" wikis:
    * http://master16.moinmo.in/ (currently same as http://master.moinmo.in/)
      This wiki is for the 1.6.x releases.
    * http://master17.moinmo.in/
      This wiki is for the 1.7.x releases.

We need your help again for updating the following (high priority and
most important stuff is on top of the list):

[X] If you didn't do this already for the 1.6 release:
    Check po file, system and help pages for errors due to conversion
    to 1.6 markup:
    * Links have new syntax, see MoinMaster:HelpOnLinking
    * Macros have new syntax, see MoinMaster:HelpOnMacros
    * Check these and other help pages (the converter did most of the
      work, but it could not auto-convert the content of PRE sections,
      thus they need manual fixing).
    * You can check what the converter has done, see action=info.

[X] There are also some notes on the http://moinmo.in/MoinDev/Translation
    page about changes that need to be done.

[X] MoinMaster:MoinI18n/%(lang)s page (source for the .po file)

[X] "%(lang)s" system pages on the MoinMaster wiki

[X] "%(lang)s" help pages on the MoinMaster wiki (optional - would be
    nice, if you had the time)

We need that until 2008-05-23 - because MoinMoin 1.7.0 will be released
then, so we can include that stuff into the distribution archive to make
people speaking your language happy. ;)

Please, after translating the current stuff, keep an eye on MoinMaster
wikis - some strings in the PO file may still change or get added/deleted.

See http://moinmo.in/MoinMoinTodo/Release%%201.7 for our planned release schedule.

Please reply immediately
========================

You can use the form below.

Or even better: directly edit the wiki page listed under Ressources.

[ ] Great! I have some time, can do it now and finish in time.

[ ] I would like to, but have no time these days. Maintenance should
    be better done by anyone else volunteering, but you can keep me
    on the list for next time.

[ ] Sorry, but can't do that any more.
    For this case, please remove yourself from the MoinI18n/%(lang)s page
    by putting ***vacant*** into the Last-Translator: metadata field.

Please, even if you can't help us this time, a fast response will help
us finding another volunteer.
