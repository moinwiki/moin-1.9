# use iso-8859-1 (or some other iso charset). If you use utf-8 (a Unicode
# encoding) you MUST use: coding: utf-8
# That setting must match the encoding your editor uses when you modify the
# settings below. If it does not, special non-ASCII chars will be wrong.

    MoinMoin - Configuration for a single wiki

    If you run a single wiki only, you can omit the farmconfig.py config
    file and just use wikiconfig.py - it will be used for every request
    we get in that case.

    Note that there are more config options than you'll find in
    the version of this file that is installed by default; see
    the module MoinMoin.config.multiconfig for a full list of names and their
    default values.

    Also, the URL http://moinmo.in/HelpOnConfiguration has
    a list of config options.

    ** Please do not use this file for a wiki farm. Use the sample file
    from the wikifarm directory instead! **

    # Wiki logo. You can use an image, text or both. [Unicode]
    # For no logo or text, use '' - the default is to show the sitename.

    # Critical setup  ---------------------------------------------------

    # Misconfiguration here will render your wiki unusable. Check that
    # all directories are accessible by the web server or moin server.

    # If you encounter problems, try to set data_dir and data_underlay_dir
    # to absolute paths.

    # Where your mutable wiki pages are. You want to make regular
    # backups of this directory.
    data_dir = './data/'

    # Where read-only system and help page are. You might want to share
    # this directory between several wikis. When you update MoinMoin,
    # you can safely replace the underlay directory with a new one. This
    # directory is part of MoinMoin distribution, you don't have to
    # backup it.
    data_underlay_dir = './underlay/'

    # The URL prefix we use to access the static stuff (img, css, js).
    # NOT touching this is maybe the best way to handle this setting as moin
    # uses a good internal default (something like '/moin_static181' for moin
    # version 1.8.1).
    # For Twisted and standalone server, the default will automatically work.
    # For others, you should make a matching server config (e.g. an Apache
    # Alias definition pointing to the directory with the static stuff).
    #url_prefix_static = '/moin_static181'


    # Security ----------------------------------------------------------

    # This is checked by some rather critical and potentially harmful actions,
    # like despam or PackageInstaller action:
    #superuser = [u"YourName", ]

    # IMPORTANT: grant yourself admin rights! replace YourName with
    # your user name. See HelpOnAccessControlLists for more help.
    # All acl_rights_xxx options must use unicode [Unicode]
    #acl_rights_before = u"YourName:read,write,delete,revert,admin"

    # The default (ENABLED) password_checker will keep users from choosing too
    # short or too easy passwords. If you don't like this and your site has
    # rather low security requirements, feel free to DISABLE the checker by:
    #password_checker = None # None means "don't do any password strength checks"

    # Link spam protection for public wikis (Uncomment to enable)
    # Needs a reliable internet connection.
    #from MoinMoin.security.antispam import SecurityPolicy


    # Mail --------------------------------------------------------------

    # remove the default links.  Leave room for user links - don't use
    # more than 6 short items.
