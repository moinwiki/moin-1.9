    MoinMoin - Configuration for a wiki farm

    If you run a single wiki only, you can keep the "wikis" list "as is"
    (it has a single rule mapping all requests to mywiki.py).

    Note that there are more config options than you'll find in
    the version of this file that is installed by default; see
    the module MoinMoin.config.multiconfig for a full list of names and their
    default values.

    Also, the URL http://moinmo.in/HelpOnConfiguration has
    a list of config options.

# Wikis in your farm --------------------------------------------------

# If you run multiple wikis, you need this list of pairs (wikiname, url
# regular expression). moin processes that list and tries to match the
# regular expression against the URL of this request - until it matches.
# Then it loads the <wikiname>.py config for handling that request.

# Important:
#  * the left part is the wikiname enclosed in double quotes
#  * the left part must be a valid python module name, so better use only
#    lower letters "a-z" and "_". Do not use blanks or "-" there!!!
#  * the right part is the url re, use r"..." for it
#  * the right part does NOT include "http://" nor "https://" at the beginning
#  * in the right part ".*" means "everything". Just "*" does not work like
#    for filenames on the shell / commandline, you must use ".*" as it is a RE.
#  * in the right part, "^" means "beginning" and "$" means "end"

wikis = [
    # Standalone server needs the port e.g. localhost:8000
    # Twisted server can now use the port, too.

    # wikiname,     url regular expression (no protocol)
    # ---------------------------------------------------------------
    ("mywiki", r".*"),   # this is ok for a single wiki

    # for multiple wikis, do something like this:
    #("moinmoin",    r"^moinmo.in/.*$"),
    #("moinmaster",  r"^master.moinmo.in/.*$"),
]


# Common configuration for all wikis ----------------------------------

# Everything that should be configured the same way should go here,
# anything else that should be different should go to the single wiki's
# config.
# In that single wiki's config, we will use the class FarmConfig we define
# below as the base config settings and only override what's different.
#
# In exactly the same way, we first include MoinMoin's Config Defaults here -
# this is to get everything to sane defaults, so we need to change only what
# we like to have different:

from MoinMoin.config.multiconfig import DefaultConfig

# Now we subclass this DefaultConfig. This means that we inherit every setting
# from the DefaultConfig, except those we explicitely define different.

class FarmConfig(DefaultConfig):

    # Critical setup  ---------------------------------------------------

    # Misconfiguration here will render your wiki unusable. Check that
    # all directories are accessible by the web server or moin server.

    # If you encounter problems, try to set data_dir and data_underlay_dir
    # to absolute paths.

    # Where your mutable wiki pages are. You want to make regular
    # backups of this directory.
    data_dir = './data/'

    # Where read-only system and help page are. You might want to share
    # this directory between several wikis. When you update MoinMoin,
    # you can safely replace the underlay directory with a new one. This
    # directory is part of MoinMoin distribution, you don't have to
    # backup it.
    data_underlay_dir = './underlay/'

    # The URL prefix we use to access the static stuff (img, css, js).
    # NOT touching this is maybe the best way to handle this setting as moin
    # uses a good internal default (something like '/moin_static181' for moin
    # version 1.8.1).
    # For Twisted and standalone server, the default will automatically work.
    # For others, you should make a matching server config (e.g. an Apache
    # Alias definition pointing to the directory with the static stuff).
    #url_prefix_static = '/moin_static181'


    # Security ----------------------------------------------------------

    # This is checked by some rather critical and potentially harmful actions,
    # like despam or PackageInstaller action:
    #superuser = [u"YourName", ]

    # IMPORTANT: grant yourself admin rights! replace YourName with
    # your user name. See HelpOnAccessControlLists for more help.
    # All acl_rights_xxx options must use unicode [Unicode]
    #acl_rights_before = u"YourName:read,write,delete,revert,admin"

    # Link spam protection for public wikis (uncomment to enable).
    # Needs a reliable internet connection.
    #from MoinMoin.security.antispam import SecurityPolicy


    # Mail --------------------------------------------------------------

    # Configure to enable subscribing to pages (disabled by default) or
    # sending forgotten passwords.

    # SMTP server, e.g. "mail.provider.com" (empty or None to disable mail)
    #mail_smarthost = ""

    # User interface ----------------------------------------------------

    # remove the default links.  Leave room for user links - don't use
    # more than 6 short items.
    # You MUST use Unicode strings here, but you need not use localized
    # page names for system and help pages, those will be used automatically
    # according to the user selected language. [Unicode]
