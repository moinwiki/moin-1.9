    # This is a sample configuration snippet that shows how to configure Xapian indexing search.

    # You must have Xapian itself and its Python bindings (xapian-core and xapian-bindings) 
    # from http://www.xapian.org/ at least in version 1.0.6 installed. 
    # In addition, Windows users need to install pywin32 from http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/. 
    # For further help see HelpOnXapian

    # Setting this to True, enables Xapian search for your MoinMoin wiki. 
    # You need to build the index from existing pages and attachments.
    # moin --config-dir=/where/your/configdir/is --wiki-url=wiki-url/ index build --mode=add
    #xapian_search = False

    # If this option is enabled, all revisions of all pages are indexed. 
    # This allows users to search in older revisions of pages 
    # if enabled in the search dialogue on FindPage. 
    xapian_index_history = True

    # If enabled, words will be indexed in their raw and stemmed forms and terms.
    # This means that searching for "testing" will also yield pages containing 
    # the words "tested", "tester" etc.
    # By changing xapian_stemming you need to rebuild the index.
    xapian_stemming = False

    # This option lets you specify a non-default directory to save your index to.
    # Initially, it gets saved to data_dir/cache/xapian/. 
    xapian_index_dir = None
