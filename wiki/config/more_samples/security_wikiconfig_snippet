    # This is a sample configuration snippet that shows how to configure security
    # features of moin, like superuser, ACLs and anti-spam / anti-abuse measures.

    # This is checked by some rather critical and potentially harmful actions,
    # like despam or PackageInstaller action:
    #superuser = [u"YourName", ]

    # IMPORTANT: grant yourself admin rights! replace YourName with
    # your user name. See HelpOnAccessControlLists for more help.
    #acl_rights_before = u"YourName:read,write,delete,revert,admin"
    #acl_rights_default = u"Trusted:read,write,delete,revert Known:read,write,delete,revert All:read,write"
    #acl_rights_after = u"" # most users don't need this
    #acl_hierarchic = False # True to use hierarchical ACLs

    #actions_excluded = ['xmlrpc'] # change this if you need xmlrpc or to forbid other actions

    # Avoid users filling your hard disk with attachments:
    #unzip_single_file_size = 2.0 * 1000 ** 2
    #unzip_attachments_space = 200.0 * 1000 ** 2
    #unzip_attachments_count = 101 # 1 zip file + 100 files contained in it

    # Link spam protection for public wikis (default is disabled!):
    # a) TextChas (see HelpOnTextChas, strongly recommended!):
    #textchas = None # a data structure with site-specific questions/answers
    #textchas_disabled_group = None # e.g. u'NoTextChasGroup' if you are a member of this group, you don't get textchas
    # b) BadContent antispam regex updates (recommended, needs a reliable internet connection):
    #from MoinMoin.security.antispam import SecurityPolicy
    #antispam_master_url = "http://master.moinmo.in/?action=xmlrpc2"

    # Rate limit for requests (use = None to disable completely)

    #    # action: (count, dt)

    #    'show': (30, 60),
    #    'recall': (10, 120),
    #    'raw': (20, 40),  # some people use this for css
    #    'AttachFile': (90, 60),
    #    'diff': (30, 60),
    #    'fullsearch': (10, 120),

    #    'default': (30, 60),
    #}
    #surge_lockout_time = 3600 # secs you get locked out when you ignore warnings

    # if nothing else helps, you can use this to deny some IPs:
    #hosts_deny = []

    # a regex of HTTP_USER_AGENTS that should be excluded from logging
    # and receive a FORBIDDEN for anything except viewing a page
    # list must not contain 'java' because of twikidraw wanting to save drawing uses this useragent
