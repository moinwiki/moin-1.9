    # This is a sample configuration snippet for a wiki which uses a Jabber
    # notification bot.

    # A secret shared with notification bot, must be the same in both configs
    # (the wiki config and the notification bot config) for communication to work.
    # CHANGE IT TO A LONG RANDOM STRING, OR YOU WILL HAVE A SECURITY ISSUE!
    secrets = u""  # alternatively, use secrets["jabberbot"]
