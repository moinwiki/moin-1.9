    # This is a sample configuration snippet that shows how to configure email support.
    # See HelpOnConfiguration/EmailSupport and HelpOnConfiguration for more infos.

    # SENDING MAIL - e.g. for page subscribtions or sending of forgotten passwords.

    # the "from:" address [Unicode]
    mail_from = u"wiki <wiki@example.org>"

    # a) using a SMTP server, e.g. "mail.provider.com" (None to disable mail)
    mail_smarthost = "smtp.example.org"

    # if you need to use SMTP AUTH at your mail_smarthost:
    #mail_login = "smtp_username smtp_password"

    # b) alternatively to using SMTP, you can use the sendmail commandline tool:
    #mail_sendmail = "/usr/sbin/sendmail -t -i"

    # preload user subscribed pages with this page list:
    #subscribed_pages_default = []


    # RECEIVING MAIL - send email to your wiki (defaults shown)
    # Note: this just configures the mail importing xmlrpc functionionality
    # within moin, you need some script called by your MDA (e.g. procmail)
    # to DO the xmlrpc calls for each mail arriving for your wiki!
    #actions_excluded = list(multiconfig.DefaultConfig.actions_excluded)
    #actions_excluded.remove('xmlrpc') # it won't work if 'xmlrpc' is excluded!
    #mail_import_subpage_template = u"$from-$date-$subject" # used for mail import
    #mail_import_pagename_search = ['subject', 'to', ] # where to look for target pagename (and in which order)
    #mail_import_pagename_envelope = u"%s" # use u"+ %s/" to add "+ " and "/" automatically
    #mail_import_pagename_regex = r'\[\[([^\]]*)\]\]' # how to find/extract the pagename from the subject
    #mail_import_wiki_addrs = [] # the e-mail addresses for e-mails that should go into the wiki
    #secrets = ""  # or secrets["xmlrpc/ProcessMail"] - a shared secret also known to the mail importer xmlrpc script
