    # This is a sample configuration snippet that shows moin's auth configuration.
    # See HelpOnSessions, HelpOnAuthentication and HelpOnConfiguration for more infos.

    # authentication methods used (default shown, see also other snippets):
    # if autocreate is True user profiles are created automatically

    # With HTTPAuthMoin moin does http basic auth all by itself:
    #from MoinMoin.auth.http import HTTPAuthMoin
    #auth = [HTTPAuthMoin(autocreate=True)]

    # With GivenAuth moin relies on the webserver doing the authentication:
    #from MoinMoin.auth import GivenAuth
    #auth = [GivenAuth(autocreate=True)]

    # a list of form field names to be disabled in the UserPreferences.
    #user_form_disable = ['name', ]
 
    # a list of form field names to be removed from the UserPreferences.
    #user_form_remove = ['password', 'password2', ]
