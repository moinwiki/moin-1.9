In this directory is a collection of pre-made logging configuration files.

You can use them like this:

from MoinMoin import log
log.load_config('.../wiki/config/logging/conffile')

This is usually located somewhere at the begging of the server script you use,
e.g. in moin.cgi, if you use cgi.

If you don't configure logging using those lines, moin will use some built-in
logging configuration (which might be correct for some cases, but incorrect
for some other cases, so be careful!).

CGI
---
You need to edit the moin.cgi that your webserver runs.

CGI / Apache: use the stderr configuration, stuff will go to apache error.log
CGI / IIS: use the logfile configuration and edit the logfile path

You can make very flexible and powerful logging configurations using this
mechanism, for more details see:
