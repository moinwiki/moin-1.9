In this directory is a collection of pre-made logging configuration files.

Typically, your server adaptor script (e.g. moin.wsgi) will have this:

from MoinMoin import log
log.load_config('wiki/config/logging/logfile') # XXX please fix this path!

You have to fix that path to use a logging configuration matching your
needs (we provide some examples in the path given there, it is relative to
the uncompressed moin distribution archive - if you use some moin package,
you maybe find it under /usr/share/moin/).

It is likely that you also have to edit the sample logging configurations
we provide (e.g. to fix the logfile location).

If you don't configure logging using those lines, moin will use some built-in
logging configuration (which might be correct for some cases, but incorrect
for some other cases, so be careful!).

WSGI

You need to edit the moin.wsgi that your webserver runs.

You can make very flexible and powerful logging configurations using this
mechanism, for more details see:
