Python requirements
===================

Please use Python 2.6.x, 2.5.x, 2.7.x, 2.4.x (in that order, first most
recommended, last least recommended).
2.4 is last because it is very OLD and not much tested any more.
2.7 is 2nd last because it is very NEW and not much tested with moin yet.

Python 2.3 is not supported by moin 1.9.x (use moin 1.8.x if you can't
upgrade Python now [but please begin planning your Python upgrade, 1.8.8 or
1.8.9 will be the last moin 1.8.x release]).

Python 3.x won't work for MoinMoin for now.

Python build options:
 * zlib support (required)
 * ucs4 (32bit unicode, recommended)
 * ucs2 also works for most users (not recommended)


Servers
=======
You can use anything that speaks WSGI to moin:
 * the "standalone" wikiserver.py we bundle with moin (recommended for
   desktop wikis, testing, debugging, development, adhoc-wikis)
 * apache with mod_wsgi (recommended for bigger/busier wikis), do not use
   mod_wsgi v2.3 (it has known problems), about any other version is fine.
 * other WSGI-compatible servers
 * cgi, fastcgi, scgi, ajp, ... also work via the "flup" middleware bundled with moin
 * For IIS 6.0 on Windows 2003, you can use a ISAPI-WSGI gateway:
   http://code.google.com/p/isapi-wsgi/ v0.4.1 has been used successfully.


Requirements needed for some moin features
==========================================

RSS feed: python-xml (pyxml) or python >= 2.5.1

GUI editor: python-xml (pyxml) - more precisely, this stuff is needed by the
            html to wiki markup converter invoked when the gui editor posts
            html on save. Status for python 2.5.x unknown.

Docbook formatter: python-xml (pyxml).

docbook parser: 4suite 1.0a4 or 1.0b1

xslt parser: 4suite 1.0a4 or 1.0b1

rst parser: docutils >= 0.3.10

Xapian indexed search: xapian libs + python bindings >= 1.0.6

Indexing filters for xapian search:
 * antiword (for indexing of MS Word documents)
 * xls2csv (for indexing of MS Excel documents, from catdoc package)
 * catppt (for indexing of MS Powerpoint documents, from catdoc package)
 * catdoc (for indexing of RTF documents, from catdoc package)
 * pdftotext (for indexing of PDFs, from xpdf-utils or poppler-utils)

ldap_login auth: python-ldap >=2.0.0pre06

mysql_group auth: MySQLdb python module

openidrp auth: openid python module

stats charts: gdchart python module

jabberbot: pyxmpp SVN revision 665 or release >= 1.0.1


Bundled 3rd party code
======================

Below are some notes about the software we bundle and ship with MoinMoin.
If you are a Linux distributor and you want to rip out this stuff and
replace it with packages, this is for you!

We list the shipped version and also the minimum required version.
The shipped version will work best with moin as usually has some more bug
fixes than the minimum required version.
We do not test with the minimum required version, but we try to keep this
file updated and correct to our best knowledge.

In case you find bugs in this requirements specification, please let us know!

Thanks to all 3rd party software authors!
