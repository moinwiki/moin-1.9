TWikiDrawPlugin Sources
-----------------------

NOTE: You don't need to compile this, a precompiled applet can be found in
      wiki/htdocs/applets/TWikiDrawPlugin

This is a modified source tree of TWikiDrawPlugin of 29 Jan 2003 - 21:47
adding:

 - basename argument
 - indexed PNG support
 - xhtml conform image maps
 - corrects object stacking order for the map

To build this plugin from sources you need the following:
 * JDK 1.2 or later version (http://java.sun.com/downloads)
 * Ant 1.5.4 or later version (http://ant.apache.org/)

To build just run change current directory to /contrib/TWikiDrawPlugin
and run Ant. Ant automatically loads build.xml from current directory 
and creates a twikidraw.jar in /contrib/TWikiDrawPlugin/build directory.

TODO:
 * look at http://moinmo.in/MoinMoinTodo/Release%201.5 - see
   the "Unfinished" section for more todo stuff relating to TWikiDraw
 * make some bash script that invokes the build process and puts the resulting
   applet into wiki/htdocs/applets/TWikiDrawPlugin
 * document build requirements
 * test with some Java enabled browser if it works :)

Applet tested on:
 * Windows XP SP 1 / Sun JDK 1.4.2 / IE 6.0 and Mozilla Firefox 1.5
