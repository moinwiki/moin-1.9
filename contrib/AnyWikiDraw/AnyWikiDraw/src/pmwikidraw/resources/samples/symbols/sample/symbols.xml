<!-- Test package of two symbols, not very interesting really... However note how I've not used
 any 'symbol-groups'.  This is the simplest wa of defining a set of symbols, and you won't see the 
 tabbed dialog *unless* groups are used.  If you do use groups, you can still have symbols defined outside
 of a symbol-group.  These symbols will be added to a 'default group' which will be given its own Tab along
 side all the other groups -->
