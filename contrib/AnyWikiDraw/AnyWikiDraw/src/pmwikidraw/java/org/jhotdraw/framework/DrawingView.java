/**
 * DrawingView renders a Drawing and listens to its changes.
 * It receives user input and delegates it to the current tool.

 * <b><a href=../pattlets/sld026.htm>Observer</a></b><br>
 * DrawingView observes drawing for changes via the DrawingListener interface.<br>

 * <b><a href=../pattlets/sld032.htm>State</a></b><br>
 * DrawingView plays the role of the StateContext in

 * <b><a href=../pattlets/sld034.htm>Strategy</a></b><br>
 * DrawingView is the StrategyContext in the Strategy pattern
 * with regard to the UpdateStrategy. <br>
 * DrawingView is the StrategyContext for the PointConstrainer.
