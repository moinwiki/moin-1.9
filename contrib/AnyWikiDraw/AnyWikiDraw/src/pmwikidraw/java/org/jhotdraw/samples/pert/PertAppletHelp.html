<H1>PERT Help</H1>
<HR>
PERT provides tools, handles, and commands to manipulate a PERT diagram.
<P>
A task is shown as a box with a line for the task's name, a line for
the task's duration, and a line for the task's earliest end time.
Only the task's name and its duration are editable. The end time
is calculated automatically by PERT.
<P>
Circular dependencies are shown in red.

<H3>Tools</H3>
The tool palette on the left offers several tools that either create
new figures or manipulate existing ones.
<Table Border=0>
<TR><TD><img src="../../images/SEL1.gif"><TD>selects, moves or resizes a figure; the shift-key
toggles the selection. Dragging the selection tool in the background
selects the figures within the dragged rectangle.
<TR><TD><img src="../../images/PERT1.gif"><TD>creates a new task</TR>
<TR><TD><img src="../../images/TEXT1.gif"><TD>creates a new or edits an existing text figure</TR>
<TR><TD><img src="../../images/CONN1.gif"><TD>creates or adjusts connections
between figures. A connection
is split into segments by dragging a point on the connection. To join two
segments click the
end point of a segment</TR>
<TR><TD><img src="../../images/LINE1.gif"><TD>creates a line figure</TR>
</Table>


<H3>Handles</H3>
When selected figures offer different handles to manipulate them.
<ul>
<li>
the blue circle handle is a connection handle. It allows to create connections
between figures.
<li>
the framed red handles are null handles. They only show the selection status
of a figure but don't support any manipulation.
<li>
the green handles are shown on connections. They enable to
reconnect them with another figure.
<li>
the yellow handle enables to change the font size of a text figure or the
size of the radius of a rounded rectangle.
</ul>

<H3>Commands</H3>
Commands are invoked from the button bar at the bottom (applet) or
from the menu bar at the top (application).
<P>
The standard commands that are provided include, cut, copy, paste,
duplicate, delete, group, ungroup, bring to front, and send to back.
<P>
<H3>Attributes</H3>
Attributes, such as fill color, text color or arrow tip, can be changed
through the attributes menu (stand-alone) or the pop up menues (applet).
