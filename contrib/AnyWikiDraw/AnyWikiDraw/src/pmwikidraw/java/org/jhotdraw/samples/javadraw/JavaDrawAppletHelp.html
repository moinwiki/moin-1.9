<HR>
JavaDraw provides <a href=#tools>tools</a>, <a href=#handles>handles</a>,
and <a href=#commands>commands</a> to manipulate a drawing.
<P>
<H3><a name=tools>Tools</a></H3>
The tools on the left create or manipulate figures.
<Table Border=0>
<TR><TD><img src="../../images/SEL1.gif"><TD>selects, moves or resizes a figure; the shift-key
toggles the selection. Dragging the selection tool in the background
selects the figures within the dragged rectangle.
<TR><TD><img src="../../images/TEXT1.gif"><TD>creates a new or edits an existing text figure</TR>
<TR><TD><img src="../../images/ATEXT1.gif"><TD>creates a new text figure and attaches it to the clicked figure. Once
a text figure is attached it remains connected to the figure.</TR>
<TR><TD><img src="../../images/URL1.gif"><TD>edits a figure's URL attribute; the URL thus associated
with a figure is followed when the figure is clicked in
the <a href="../../../../../JavaDrawViewer.html">viewer applet</a></TR>
<TR><TD><img src="../../images/RECT1.gif"><TD>creates a rectangle figure</TR>
<TR><TD><img src="../../images/RRECT1.gif"><TD>creates a round rectangle figure</TR>
<TR><TD><img src="../../images/ELLIPSE1.gif"><TD>creates an ellipse figure</TR>
<TR><TD><img src="../../images/LINE1.gif"><TD>creates a line figure</TR>
<TR><TD><img src="../../images/CONN1.gif"><TD>creates or adjusts connections between figures. A connection
is split into segments by dragging a point on the connection. To join two segments click the end point of a segment</TR>
<TR><TD><img src="../../images/OCONN1.gif"><TD>creates an elbow connection and offers the same features as the ordinary connection tool</TR>
<TR><TD><img src="../../images/SCRIBBL1.gif"><TD>creates a scribble figure; dragging the mouse creates
a smooth line while successive clicks yields a polyline figure</TR>
<TR><TD><img src="../../images/BORDDEC1.gif"><TD>decorates the clicked figure with a border</TR>
</Table>


<H3><a name=handles>Handles</a></H3>
When selected figures provide different handles to manipulate them.
<ul>
<li>
the filled red handles enable to manipulate the shape of a figure
<li>
the blue circle handle is a connection handle. It allows to create connections
between figures.
<li>
the framed red handles are null handles. They only show the selection status
of a figure but don't support any manipulation.
<li>
the green handles are shown on connections. They enable to
reconnect them with another figure.
<li>
the yellow handle enables to change the font size of a text figure or the
size of the radius of a rounded rectangle.
</ul>
<H3><a name=commands>Commands</a></H3>
Commands are invoked from the button bar at the bottom (applet) or
from the menu bar at the top (application).
<P>
The standard commands that are provided include, cut, copy, paste,
duplicate, delete, group, ungroup, bring to front, and send to back.
<P>
<H3>Attributes</H3>
Attributes, such as fill color, text color or arrow tip, can be changed
through the attributes menu (stand-alone) or the pop up menues (applet).
