/**
 *  Property change listener that holds weak reference to a
 *  target property change listener.  If the weak reference
 *  becomes null (meaning the delegate has been GC'ed) then this
 *  listener will remove itself from any beans that it receives
 *  events from.  It isn't perfect, but it's a lot better than
 *  nothing... and presumably beans that no longer send out events
 *  probably don't care if their listeners weren't properly cleaned
 *  up.
 *
 *  Design pattern: Proxy.
