/**
 * A <em>composite figure</em> is composed of several child {@link Figure}s.
 * A composite figure can be laid out using a {@link Layouter}.
 *
 * <hr>
 * <b>Design Patterns</b>
 *
 * <p><em>Framework</em><br>
 * The following interfaces define the contracts of a framework for structured
 * drawing editors:<br>
 * Contract: {@link Drawing}, {@link Figure}, {@link CompositeFigure},
 * {@link ConnectionFigure}, {@link Connector}, {@link DrawingView},
 * {@link DrawingEditor}, {@link Handle} and {@link Tool}.
 *
 * <p><em>Composite</em><br>
 * Composite figures can be composed of other figures.<br>
 * Component: {@link Figure}; Composite: {@link CompositeFigure}.
 *
 * <p><em>Observer</em><br>
 * State changes of figures can be observed by other objects. Specifically
 * {@code CompositeFigure} observes area invalidations and remove requests
 * of its child figures. {@link DrawingView} also observes area invalidations
 * of its drawing object.<br>
 * Subject: {@link Figure}; Observer:
 * {@link FigureListener}; Event: {@link FigureEvent}; Concrete Observer:
 * {@link CompositeFigure}, {@link DrawingView}.
 *
 * <p><em>Observer</em><br>
 * Changes in the composition of a composite figure can be observed.<br>
 * Subject: {@link CompositeFigure}; Observer:
 * {@link CompositeFigureListener}; Event: {@link CompositeFigureEvent}.
 *
 * <p><em>Strategy</em><br>
 * Composite figures can be laid out using different layout algorithms which
 * are implemented by layouters.<br>
 * Context: {@link CompositeFigure}; Strategy: {@link Layouter}.
