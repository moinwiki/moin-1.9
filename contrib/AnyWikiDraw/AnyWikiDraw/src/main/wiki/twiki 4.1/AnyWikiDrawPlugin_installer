---+ AnyWikiDrawPlugin_installer
This is the installer script. The basic function of this script is to
locate an archive and unpack it.

It will also check the dependencies listed in DEPENDENCIES and assist
the user in installing any that are missing. The script also automatically
maintains the revision histories of any files that are being installed by the
package but already have ,v files on disc (indicating that they are
revision controlled).

The script also functions as an *uninstaller* by passing the parameter
=uninstall= on the command-line. Note that uninstallation does *not* revert
the history of any topic changed during the installation.

The script allows the definition of PREINSTALL and POSTINSTALL scripts.
These scripts can be used for example to modify the configuration during
installation, using the functions described below.

Refer to the documentation of =configure=
