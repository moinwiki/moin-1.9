# Image file Please
# enter any images you would like your users to see in here, if the filename
# is not in here then the user will not be able to use that image in their
# drawings.
#
# Note that any subdirectories in here will appear as submenus/groups in the
# image selection utilities in PmWikiDraw
# To get a space in your group name please use the alternate chracter '_' in both
# the physical directory name and the reference below, the plugin
# will automatically convert '_' to ' ' for display but use it for fetching the image.
# This is to work around a strange bug in the latest (1.5.0 Java Applet VM) 

#Samples showing example grouping.
