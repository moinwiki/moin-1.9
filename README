ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
================

We like to thank especially these people, groups and companies for their
valuable ideas and contributions:

    Ward Cunningham <ward@c2.com> for inventing WikiWiki in the first place.

    Martin Pool <mbp@humbug.org.au> for providing the base of what now is
    MoinMoin, see also docs/licenses/pikipiki.txt.

    Marko Schulz <Marko.Schulz@gmx.de> for providing input on the first
    versions of MoinMoin as it evolved.

    Tom Holroyd <tomh@po.crl.go.jp> provided the set of emoticons that come
    with the standard distribution, and came up with the idea to add that
    feature.

    Richard Jones <richard@bizarsoftware.com.au> who provided so much code
    in so little time that I could not keep up with him. He works on company
    time, though (unless I'm mistaken). Also found the nasty security hole
    in release 0.6.

    Christian Bird <chris.bird@lineo.com> provided some nice ideas and some
    code.

    Peter Thoeny and all other people involved in creating TWikiDrawPlugin;
    for copyright information see docs/licenses/twikidraw.txt; for more
    information and a download link to get the source refer to
    http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/TWiki/TWikiDrawPlugin

    Thomas Waldmann for the major effort of translating all the help and
    system pages to German, and increasing volumes of code.

    Bernhard Rosenkraenzer and Andrew Bennetts for password login patches.

    Florian Festi, Bastian Blank, Oliver Graf and Nir Soffer for many code
    contributions.

    Alexander Schremmer for much testing work, code contributions and
    finally fixing the win32 stuff.

    Arcelor S.A. for sponsoring MoinMoin v1.5 GPL development.

    All language maintainers for translating MoinMoin to many languages and
    keeping those translations up-to-date.

    And all the people we forgot or that are mentioned in the code.
